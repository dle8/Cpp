Inclusive scan (cut points): takes (x[0], x[1], ..., x[n - 1]) into (x[0], x[0] ⊕ x[1], x[0] ⊕ x[1] ⊕ x[2], ..., x[0] ⊕ x[1] ... ⊕  x[n - 1])
Exclusive scan (beginning points): takes (x[0], x[1], ..., x[n - 1]) into (0, x[0], x[0] ⊕ x[1] ⊕ x[2], ..., x[0] ⊕ x[1] ... ⊕  x[n - 2])

In order to turn inclusive scan to exclusive scan, shift the elements to the right 1 pos, and fill the first element with 0.
Vice versa, in order to turn exclusive scan to inclusive scan, shift the elements to the left 1 pos, and fill in the last element.
