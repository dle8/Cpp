Corner turning:
- If an algorithm requires a kernel code to iterate through data along the row
operation, one can use shared memory to enable memory coalescing. Threads of a 
block can first cooperatively load the tiles into the shared memory. CARE MUST BE
TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT THESE TILES ARE LOADED IN A COALESCED PATTERN. Once the 
data is in shared memory, they can be accessed either on a row basis or a column 
basis with much less performance variation because the shared memories are 
implemented as intrinsically high-speed on-chip memory that does not require 
coalescing to achieve high data access rate.
