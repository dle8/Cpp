/*
    OOP in C++ can be used using "class" and "struct" in C++. "Struct" has default public members and bases, while "Class" has default private
    member and bases. Both can have a mixtureof public, protected, and private members, can use inheritance and member functions.

    private, public, protected:
        - private: a member declared in a private section of a class can only be accessed by member fuctions and friends of that class
        - protected: a member declared in a protected section of a class can only be accessed by member functions and friends of that class, and
        by member and friends of derived class
        - public: a member declared in a public section of a class can be accessed by anyone
